**Axiom is a dynamic infrastructure framework** to efficiently work with multi-cloud environments, build and deploy repeatable infrastructure focussed on offensive and defensive security. 

Axiom works by pre-installing your tools of choice onto a 'base image', and then using that image to deploy fresh instances. From there, you can connect and instantly gain access to many tools useful for both bug hunters and pentesters. With the power of immutable infrastructure, most of which is done for you, you can just spin up 15 boxes, perform a distributed nmap/ffuf/screenshotting scan, and then shut them down.  

Because you can create many disposable instances very easily, axiom allows you to distribute scans of many different tools (full list [here]( https://github.com/pry0cc/axiom#tools-to-date)). Once installed and setup, you can distribute a scan of a large set of targets across 100-150 instances within minutes and get results extremely quickly. This is called [axiom-scan](https://github.com/pry0cc/axiom/wiki/Scans).

Axiom supports several cloud providers, eventually, axiom should be completely cloud agnostic allowing unified control of a wide variety of different cloud environments with ease. Currently, DigitalOcean, IBM Cloud, Linode, Azure and AWS are officially supported providers. GCP isnt supported but is partially implemented and on the roadmap. If you would like prioritization of a feature or provider implementation, please contact me @pry0cc on Twitter and we can discuss :)

# Installation
## Docker

This will create a docker container, initiate [`axiom-configure`](https://github.com/pry0cc/axiom/wiki/Filesystem-Utilities#axiom-configure) and [`axiom-build`](https://github.com/pry0cc/axiom/wiki/Filesystem-Utilities#axiom-build) and then drop you out of the docker container. Once the [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) image is successfully created, you will likely need to re-exec into your docker container via `docker exec -it $container_id zsh`.
```
docker exec -it $(docker run -d -it --platform linux/amd64 ubuntu:20.04) sh -c "apt update && apt install git -y && git clone https://github.com/pry0cc/axiom ~/.axiom/ && cd && .axiom/interact/axiom-configure"
```

## Easy Install

You should use an OS that supports our [easy install](https://github.com/pry0cc/axiom#operating-systems-supported). <br>
For Linux systems you will also need to install the newest versions of all packages beforehand `sudo apt dist-upgrade`. <br>
```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pry0cc/axiom/master/interact/axiom-configure)
```

If you have any problems with this installer, or if using an unsupported OS please refer to [Installation](https://github.com/pry0cc/axiom/wiki/0-Installation).

# Demo
In this demo (sped up out of respect for your time ;) ), we show how easy it is to initialize and ssh into a new instance.

# Contributors
We've had some really fantastic additions to axiom, great feedback through issues, and perseverence through our heavy beta phase!

A list of all contributors can be found [here](https://github.com/pry0cc/axiom/graphs/contributors), thank you all!

# Art
The [original logo](https://github.com/pry0cc/axiom/blob/master/screenshots/axiom-logo.png) was made by our amazing [s0md3v](https://twitter.com/s0md3v)! Thank you for making axiom look sleek as hell! Really beats my homegrown logo :)

The awesome referral banners were inspired by [fleex](https://github.com/FleexSecurity/fleex) and were made by the one and only [xm1k3](https://twitter.com/xm1k3_)!

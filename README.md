**Axiom is a dynamic infrastructure framework** to efficiently work with multi-cloud environments, build and deploy repeatable infrastructure focussed on offensive and defensive security. 

Axiom works by pre-installing your tools of choice onto a 'base image', and then using that image to deploy fresh instances. From there, you can connect and instantly gain access to many tools useful for both bug hunters and pentesters. With the power of immutable infrastructure, most of which is done for you, you can just spin up 15 boxes, perform a distributed nmap/ffuf/screenshotting scan, and then shut them down.  

Because you can create many disposable instances very easily, axiom allows you to distribute scans of many different tools including amass aquatone arjun assetfinder dalfox dnsgen dnsx feroxbuster fff ffuf findomain gau gobuster gospider gowitness hakrawler httprobe httpx jaeles kiterunnter masscan massdns meg naabu nmap nuclei paramspider puredns rustscan s3scanner shuffledns & subfinder. Once installed and setup, you can distribute a scan of a large set of targets across 10-15 instances within minutes and get results extremely quickly. This is called [axiom-scan](https://github.com/pry0cc/axiom/wiki/Scans).

Axiom supports several cloud providers, eventually, axiom should be completely cloud agnostic allowing unified control of a wide variety of different cloud environments with ease. Currently, DigitalOcean, IBM Cloud, Linode and Azure are officially supported providers. Google Compute is partially implemented and AWS is on the roadmap. If you would like prioritization of a feature or provider implementation, please contact me @pry0cc on Twitter and we can discuss :)

## Installation - Easy Install

You will also need to install the newest versions of all packages `sudo apt dist-upgrade` and curl, which is not installed by default on Ubuntu 20.04, if you get a "command not found" error, run `sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl`.
<br>
<br> Run the following curl command, as your standard user, not as root.

```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pry0cc/axiom/master/interact/axiom-configure)
```

If you have any problems with this installer, please refer to [Installation](https://github.com/pry0cc/axiom/wiki/0-Installation).

## Demo
In this demo (sped up out of respect for your time ;) ), we show how easy it is to initialize and ssh into a new instance.
